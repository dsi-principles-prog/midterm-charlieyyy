# midterm project


## project Goal
The purpose of this project is to classify a given silhouette as one of four types of vehicle,  using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. 

## motivation
Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van,Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400.  This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with theexpectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it wouldbe more difficult to distinguish between the cars

# data source
The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.The features were extracted from the silhouettes by the HIPS (Hierarchical Image Processing Sys-tem) extension BINATTS. Detailed explanation of column variable could be found at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlbench/mlbench.pdf.
